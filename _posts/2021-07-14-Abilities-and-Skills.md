#  Most societies are formed around a given ideology or way of thinking.  These ideologies can be broken up into several different categories.  At the higher tech levels where people have more freetime, those societies will have multiple ideologies from all four segments operating together within their borders.  Each group will have various taboos, symbols, concepts, hierarchies, buildings, trade goods, occupations, equipment, stories, and legends that they have a monopoly on.   It should be noted that ideologies can exist with other ideologies.

In the image above we see Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, more commonly known just as Raphael, picture of The School of Athens.  One of their chief subjects surrounded on the nature of mankind.  Is a man a mind and a body?  Is a man a mind, a body, and a spirit?   

We do not need to delve into the various aspects of these philosophical arguments here, however when devising a role playing game system we do need to answer the question, what aspects of mankind do we want to model within our system? What impacts are important for narrative tension.  I am going to argue that there are four primary impacts that can be made.  The first is physical.  The second is mental.  The third is social.  The fourth is spiritual.  If we can track these four areas we can understand a given characters Body, Mind, Self Image, and their Soul.

Another aspect we need to understand is what sort of things about these areas we need to keep track of to differentiate various people from each other.  The areas we need to track minimally are the Strength, Speed, and Capacity of someones Body, Mind, Self Image, and Soul.  

## Body

### Muscle

Muscle measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Athletics

Your Athletics check covers demanding situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. 

#### Drive / Ride / Pilot

You might also need an Acrobatics check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips. 

#### Sleight of Hand

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Sleight of Hand check. You might also need a Sleight of Hand check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket. 

#### Ranged Combat

Your Ranged Combat ability check measures your characters ability to attack and survive in a ranged combat.

### Stamina

This ability score represents how healthy your character is. Eventually the hero will be struck by someone else in combat, or their body will be sustaining damage from the environment they exist in. Such events will challenge the stamina of the hero. If the hero makes it into the twilight years of their life, they will see their stamina start to slip away as time itself takes its toll on the hero’s body. Stamina can be restored by spending time with loved ones. Stamina can also be restored using various medicinal foods, drinks, and poultices.

#### Ruggedness

Make a Ruggedness check when you attempt to Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door, break free of bonds, push through a tunnel that is too small. You might also need a Ruggedness check to see if you can hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it, tip over a statue, or keep a boulder from rolling. [^5EOGL]

### Acuity

This ability score represents your character’s ability to synthesize information optimally. Eventually a hero will have to confront the loss of a loved one or see things that damage the mind, such events will challenge the hero’s mental acuity. If a Hero makes it into the twilight years of their lives, their acuity will slip into various forms of instability and disconnection from reality as the mind protects itself from the ravages of reality. Acuity can be restored by spending time with family, friends, in meditation, or temporarily the consumption of various foods and drinks can restore acuity.

#### Survival

You might be asked to make a Survival check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.  Another aspect of Survival is the ability to navigate within a given environment.  

#### Perception

Your character’s Perception check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.
