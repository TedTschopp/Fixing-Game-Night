## Introduction

### Rules of Process
Process rules are rules that tell you how the interaction will be between players and characters.  In the example here, I will focus on a request from a player to have their character gamble. 

#### Example: D&D 5e Gambling Process
In D&D 5e this is done over the course of one week of game time.  They will need to put together a stake of 10gp to 1000gp (or more if the GM allows).  Then the player makes some resolution checks.

#### Example: James Bond Gambling Process


### Rules of Resolution

#### Example: D&D 5e Gambling Resolution
The player roles three checks: Wisdom(Insight), Charisma (Deception), and Charisma (Intimidation).  If the player is proficient with a given gambling tool set (cards, dice, etc...) and they are playing the game with that tool set, they can choose to use that skill instead in the checks that use those tools.  The DC for each check is 5+2d10.  Then a table is consulted with all three successes doubling your stake.  Two successes you get your stake back plus 50%.  One success is you love 50% of your stake.  No successes means you lose all your stake, and go into debt to the amount of 50% of your stake.

Finally, every week you spend gambling, you have a 10% chance of a complication.  These complications range from cheating, to revenge, to crime bosses showing interest.

#### Example: James Bond Gambling Resolution for Blackjack

All the card games are played using a two-step procedure.  A first roll is made using the character's Gambling skill at an East Factor of 5ll the result of the roll simulate the deal.  The player then has the option to roll a second time (simulating the draw, an extra card, and so on), which may or may not improve the hand.  This second roll simulates the back-and-forth game playing that takes place after the deal.  Bettering is done as it is in the real game - either before the deal, after it, and/or after the second roll, as appropriate.  All the dice rolling is done in secret (the GM rolls the dice for the NPCs), so the betting is done without foreknowledge of the other players hands (that is, the respective Quality Ratings).  Note that Quality Rating 5 always beats a failure result.

>The second die roll is also done at an Ease Factor of 5.  The only instance where a modifier would be applied to the rolls would be for the environment (smoke, noise, and the like) which might distract the players attention. 

>If an NPC is playing against the PC, the GM will roll for the NPC.  The rolls are made in secret.  If there are other players present, each player should roll their dice in secret and each player reveals their dice in the order of play.   

The final combined quality rating is used to determine who wins; the character with the higher quality rating is the winner.  If the two Quality Ratings tie, the tie is resolved in the following order of precedent: Character with the higher Gambling Skill Level; then the character with the higher Fame Point total; then, finally, the character with the higher Perception.  Note that in blackjack a tie can be resolved as a "push" (depending on the house rules of the casino), with neither side winning and the bets staying on the table.  

> Only a player actively participating in a game can use Hero Points to alter the Quality Ratings.  A player placing a side bet may not use Hero Points nor loan a point to another player.  Hero Points can not be used in games of complete chance, like roulette. Hero Points can chance a Quality Rating from a 1 to a 1+.

In Blackjack the first Quality Rating is used to determine the first two cards.  If the player wishes, he may then add more cards by rolling a second time.  A player may stand on his initial roll. Since there will often be a number of players going against the dealer, there may be a number of winners and losers each hand.
